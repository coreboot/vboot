 * General notes:
 *
 * All verified boot functions now start with "Vb" for namespace clarity.  This
 * fixes the problem where uboot and vboot both defined assert().
 *
 * Verified boot APIs to be implemented by the calling firmware and exported to
 * vboot_reference start with "VbEx".
 *
 * TODO: split this file into a vboot_entry_points.h file which contains the
 * entry points for the firmware to call vboot_reference, and a
 * vboot_firmware_exports.h which contains the APIs to be implemented by the
 * calling firmware and exported to vboot_reference.
